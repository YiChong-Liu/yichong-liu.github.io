    <p class="introduction">
        I'm Yichong Liu, a software developer and a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics at 
        <a href="https://www.umass.edu/" target="_blank" text-primary> UMass Amherst</a>. <br>
        My interests mainly lie in software engineering, full stack development and I have done some interesting projects. Check out my <a href="project.html" target="_blank" text-primary>Project Page</a> here. <br>
        
        Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or want to collaborate with some fun projects.<br><br>

        In my spare time, I love playing basketball, badminton and Ping Pong. I watch a lot of NBA games and greatly appreciate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James" target="_blank" text-primary> Lebron James</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant" target="_blank" text-primary> Kobe Bryant</a>. <br>
        I love playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" target="_blank" text-primary> Weiqi / Go</a> mainly inherited from my father. And I'm playing chess with my friends as well. <br>
        I'm also interested in learning economics and investing in stock markets.<br><br>
        I believe not only learning but also be well-travelled makes myself <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%AF%BB%E4%B8%87%E5%8D%B7%E4%B9%A6%EF%BC%8C%E8%A1%8C%E4%B8%87%E9%87%8C%E8%B7%AF" target="_blank" text-primary>a better person.</a><br>
        I've been to a lot of cities in China including Chengdu (My hometown), Chongqing, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Shanghai, Harbin and Kunming, etc.<br>
        I also went to Europe and Japan and now I'm exploring new places to go in the United States. <br><br>
